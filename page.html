    <p>Hi! My name is Thang. I'm a student at Clark College and this is my third terms at Clark College.</p>
    <p>I would like to learn some new things about coding, and I want to get more practice on coding to improve my
        skills.</p>
    <p>My level of programming skill like 5/10. Causing I just learned Python stuff and I don't have any experience
        with another coding, that's why I'm here now.</p>
